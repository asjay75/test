- Stop traffic from malicious actors based on their specific reputation score, which is derived from Akamaiâ€™s visibility into prior behavior of their IP addresses. 
- Automatically inspect API requests for malicious content and block attack tools based on device fingerprinting. 
- SSL/TLS encryption to prevent sensitive data exposure during transmission
- API Gateway validates API requests to ensure legitimate consumers can access APIs. 
- API responses can be served from cache to improve performance and reduce infrastructure and bandwidth costs. 
- Capture, retain, and deliver security information and events to your SIEM application in real time
