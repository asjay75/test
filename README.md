### Varnish(Cache ser
vice)

- All Requests, except authorize call from Client to API service goes via Varnish
- Varnish will Cache all the response from API service depending on the cache-control(max-age) set on the response header.



### Flight Service

- Client will call API service to get the JWT token .
- API service will make  asynchronous   calls to 5 downstream services to get the Flight Data for the input provided .
- Flight Number is Returned  to Client.

##  Service @ Scale


### High availably setup 

- Two AWS Region is considered 
- Each region , Two Availability Zone is Considered .
- Cluster Database is setup across each region .

### Akamai Edge Solution is Considered 


- Edge servers automatically drop network-layer DDoS attacks and protect the application layer from DDoS and application attacks. 
- Stop traffic from malicious actors based on their specific reputation score, which is derived from Akamaiâ€™s visibility into prior behavior of their IP addresses. 
- Automatically inspect API requests for malicious content and block attack tools based on device fingerprinting. 
- SSL/TLS encryption to prevent sensitive data exposure during transmission
- API Gateway validates API requests to ensure legitimate consumers can access APIs. 
- API responses can be served from cache to improve performance and reduce infrastructure and bandwidth costs. 
- Capture, retain, and deliver security information and events to your SIEM application in real time
