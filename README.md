## Installation

### With Docker

```
$ composer require nesbot/carbon
```

```json
{
    "require": {
        "nesbot/carbon": "^2.16"
    }
}
```

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Carbon\Carbon;

printf("Now: %s", Carbon::now());
```

### Without Docker

Why are you not using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)? Download the Carbon [latest release](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases) and put the contents of the ZIP archive into a directory in your project. Then require the file `autoload.php` to get all classes and dependencies loaded on need.

```php
<?php
require 'path-to-Carbon-directory/autoload.php';

use Carbon\Carbon;

printf("Now: %s", Carbon::now());
```
